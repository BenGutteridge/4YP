# 4YP

Repo for experiment code from project investigating single sample gradient estimation in variational inference.

To Do over Christmas break:
- Experiment with updating parameter `m` only, investigate if the autodiff is actually working.
- Get it working, and get it to work with batch GD as well
- Compare single sample and batch, and if time, look into the impact of step size in conjunction with batch size - e.g. can we take larger steps with truer gradient, etc? See book.
- Writeup literature review and methodology more properly
